# Dice-Roll

This Python script is a simple console-based dice game for 2 to 4 players, where the objective is to be the first to reach or exceed 50 points. The game starts by asking the user to input the number of players, validating that the input is an integer within the allowed range. Once the players are set, each takes turns rolling a six-sided die using the 'roll()' function, which generates a random number between 1 and 6. During their turn, a player can roll multiple times to accumulate points, but if they roll a 1, their turn ends immediately, and they score nothing for that round. Rolling any other number adds to their turn’s score, and they can choose to either continue rolling or end their turn to add the points to their total score. The game continues in a loop, with players alternating turns, until one player’s total score reaches 50 or more. At that point, the game declares the player with the highest score as the winner. This script is an effective example of using Python basics like loops, conditionals, and lists to create an interactive game, making it a great learning tool for beginners in programming and game development.
