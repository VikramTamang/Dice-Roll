# Dice-Roll
This Python script is a simple, console-based dice game designed for 2 to 4 players, where the goal is to be the first player to reach or exceed a score of 50 points. The game begins by prompting the user to input the number of players, ensuring the input is a valid integer within the specified range. Once the number of players is set, each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die, simulated by the 'roll()' function, which generates a random integer between 1 and 6. During a player’s turn, they can roll the die repeatedly to accumulate points. However, if the player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately, and they gain no points for that round, effectively resetting their turn’s score to zero. If they roll any number other than 1, that number is added to their current turn’s score, and they have the option to either roll again or end their turn and add the accumulated points to their total score. The game continues in a loop, with players taking turns to roll the die and accumulate points, until one player’s total score reaches or exceeds 50 points. Once this happens, the game identifies the player with the highest score as the winner and announces them along with their final score. The script is a straightforward example of how to use basic Python constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and list operations to create an interactive game. It also highlights the importance of managing user input, handling edge cases (such as rolling a 1), and maintaining game state across multiple turns, making it a useful exercise for beginners learning Python programming and game development basics.
